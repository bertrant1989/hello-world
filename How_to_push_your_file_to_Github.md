This readme file contains how should I push the work that I have done to Github.com
The first thing to do is to write up my own file, on sublime text or Matlab or Latex and so on.
2. Go to the folder that I saved my work, which is Dropbox/Github/hello-world.
3. Type "git status", after which there will be a message showing up, indicates the changes you have made and has not been pushed up to Github
4. Type "git add ****.***" by mean ****.*** which should be the file you just added or modified.
5. Type "git status" to make sure everything has been up-to-date and you are ready to push the files you have changed to Github
6. Type " git commit -m "added ****.***" " by meaning that you just send a message to Github that you have add the file you wanted.
7. Refresh your index page on Github and you suppose to see the uploaded file.
8. Type "git" will show you all commands.
9. If you accidentally typed "git commit" without "-m" after it, something wierd will pop up, use "esc" and type ":wq" to exit without saving any changes. You have to save the changes agian.
